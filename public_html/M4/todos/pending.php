/* Refer to the HTML table below and build a query that'll select the columns in the same order as the table from the Todo table.
Cross-reference the HTML table columns with what'd most plausibly match the SQL table aside from the notes below.
For the Status part, you'll need to calculate the "days_offset" from the due date, ensure the virtual column matches "days_offset".
For Actions, this isn't part of the query and there's nothing special to select for it.
Filter the results where the todo item is NOT completed and order the results by those due the soonest.
No limit is required.
